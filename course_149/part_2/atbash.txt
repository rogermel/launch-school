Understand the problem:
Description:
	- Create an implementation of the atbash ciper encryption
	- in class Atbash, use a contante hash to store letter to cipher code (CIPHER)

Implicit knowledge from test suite:
	- digit are not converted and are return as-is
	- character other than letter and digit should be removed from original string
	- add a space character after a group of five letter but not for last word of 5 chars

Description of Atbash class:
	- class method :encode

Atbash#encode:
Input: string
Output: coded cipher chain
Algorithm of Atbash#encode:
	- initialize out as an array
	- do the following with input string
		- strip any space
		- downcase the string input
		- global substitute character other than [a-z0-9] by nothing => ''
	- enumerate with index:
		- append CIPHER value if value is included? in CIPER
		- else append value as it is
		- append space if (index + 1) can be divided by 5 and it is not the last iteration
	- join and return
