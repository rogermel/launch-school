Understand the problem:
Description:
	- Octal class perform the conversion from a string of octal number into decimal
	- If the octal string is invalid then 0 is the decimal value

Implicit knowledge:
	- Base-8 valid number range from 0..7 => anu other character will make an invalid octal number

Description of Octal class:
	- Octal#octal? will check is number provided is valid octal representation
	- ocatal number will be saved in @octal instance variable

Octal#octal?:
Input: none
Output: boolean
Algorithm of Octal#to_decimal:
	- refactoring:
		- does all? character in @octal instance variable match the RegEx for octal number => /[0-7]/


Octal#to_decimal:
Input: none
Output: integer
Algorithm of Octal#to_decimal:
	- return 0 if @octal is not a valid octal number
	- shift the first character if value is '0'
	- map to integer
	- reverse the array
	- inject with index the number power 8 the exponent
