Understand the problem:
Input:
	- integer
Output:
	- array of all primes number from 2 up to the number provided as argument

Description of Series class:
	- save the object Range into a @range and transform to an array
	- provide a default value for initialize method
	- public method :primes

Sieve#primes:
Input: none
Output: array
Algorithm of Sieve#primes:
	- for each element in the range
		- reject permanently all integer which are multiple of the current number
