Understand the problem:
Input:
	- integer
Output:
	- array of all primes number from 2 up to the number provided as argument

Description of Series class:
	- save the object Range into a @range instance variable during initialization
	- provide a default value for initialize method
	- public method :primes
	- private method :primes?

Sieve#primes:
Input: none
Output: array
Algorithm of Sieve#primes:
	- raise an ArgumentError if argument is not an Integer
	- transform a Range to an array
	- select all prime number by applying the prime? method to each element of the array

Implicit knowleged:
	- a prime number can only by divided by 1 or itself

Sieve#prime?:
Input: integer
Output: boolean
Algorithm of Sieve#primes?:
	- for each integer in the range, return false if argument % n (current number in the range) is equal
	  to 0
	- return true, if we reach that point it means that the number is prime
